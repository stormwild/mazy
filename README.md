Simple Js Maze Game

## Description

Building upon [Nate Jones](http://jsfiddle.net/n8j1s/4y22135r/) sample js maze game among others.

The data structure is a simple array of arrays which makes up the maze.

We need to generate a random maze or data structure similar to the board array.

The solution is to generate an acyclic graph or tree specifically a spanning tree (a tree comprises every node in a graph).

## Notes

```bash
npm i -D webpack babel-loader babel-core
npm i -D html-webpack-plugin

npm install css-loader style-loader sass-loader node-sass --save-dev
npm install --save-dev extract-text-webpack-plugin
```

## Setup Notes

```
npm install --save jquery
```

Import jquery in app.js `import 'jquery`

```
// In webpack config add webpack's built in ProvidePlugin to the plugins array

new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
  jQuery: 'jquery',
  $: 'jquery',
  jquery: 'jquery'
})
```
