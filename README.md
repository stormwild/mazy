Simple Js Maze Game

## Description

Building upon [Nate Jones](http://jsfiddle.net/n8j1s/4y22135r/) sample js maze game among others.

The data structure is a simple array of arrays which makes up the maze.

We need to generate a random maze or data structure similar to the board array.

The solution is to generate an acyclic graph or tree specifically a spanning tree (a tree comprises every node in a graph).
